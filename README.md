This project creates a recipe book and allows the user to input 7 recipes that allows for 6 ingredients each. 
The program also allows the user to enter up to 20 ingredients that they have and there is a function that allows for you to choose
which recipe, and it will check to see if you have all of the necesary ingredients. 
This program contains 3 files, 2 which are my project, and one is a tester file that shows that the class works. 
Any issues running the program, I coded this on codeHS.com so you can use this link https://codehs.com/share/lets_try_this_again_IXfjPf
